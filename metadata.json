  "description": "2-step discrete quantum walk on a 4-node cycle using Hadamard coin (1 coin qubit, 2 position qubits).",
  "long_description": "A discrete quantum walk is the quantum analogue of a classical random walk. A 'coin' qubit in superposition drives conditional position shifts: |0\u27e9 steps left, |1\u27e9 steps right. Unlike a classical walk, the quantum walker can be in superposition of positions, creating interference patterns. After t steps the probability distribution spreads quadratically faster than classically. This circuit runs 2 steps on a 4-node cycle.",
